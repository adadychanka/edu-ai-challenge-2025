**Title:** Logout Button Unresponsive in Safari

**Description:** The logout button functionality is completely non-responsive when using the Safari browser. Users are unable to log out of the application as the button does not trigger any action when clicked.

**Steps To Reproduce:**

1. Open the application in Safari browser
2. Log in to the application
3. Attempt to click the logout button
4. Observe that no action occurs

**Expected Behavior:** The logout button should respond to clicks and successfully log the user out of the application, redirecting them to the login page or home page.

**Actual Behavior:** The logout button is completely unresponsive - clicking it produces no action or response from the application.

**Environment:**

- Browser: Safari
- Note: Specific Safari version not provided in input

**Impact:** Users are unable to log out of the application when using Safari, potentially forcing them to close the browser or clear cookies to end their session.

**Severity:** Sev2 (High)

- Rationale: This is a critical functionality issue that affects user security and session management, but it's limited to a specific browser.

**Notes:**

- The input did not specify the Safari version
- The input did not specify the application version
- The input did not specify the operating system
- The input did not specify if this issue occurs in other browsers
