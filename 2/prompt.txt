You need to convert the informal bug description into a structured bug report. 
You need to extract as many details as possible from the input to fit the structure. 
Use the best possible and suitable pattern you know for the fields. Apply necessary formatting to make the bug report visually appealing. Preferred format is markdown.
If any of the fields could not be extracted from the input, take a note.
Don't hallucinate if something is unknown, this is unknown.

The structure of a bug report is as follows: 
Title: ${SHORT_BUG_TITLE}
Description: ${BUG_DESCRIPTION}
Steps To Reproduce: ${BUG_STEPS}
Expected Behavior: ${BUG_EXPECTED_BEHAVIOR}
Actual Behavior: ${BUG_ACTUAL_BEHAVIOR}
Environment: ${BUG_ENVIRONMENT}
Impact: ${BUG_IMPACT}
Severity: ${BUG_SEVERITY}
