Imagine you are the tech lead and the project's architect with a solid background of 20+ years. The project is a social platform that is gonna be built from scratch. 
The expected user base is in the millions, and it is expected to grow. The database is expected to store entities like profiles, posts, and connections between users. 
High data read speed required. 
Expected 80% read operations, 20% write operations. 
Scalability is important.

Your task is to find a type of database that is better suited for the requirements. You should provide a thoughtful explanation and perform an analysis step-by-step so I can see the logic behind the choice.
