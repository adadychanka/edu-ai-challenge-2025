I'll help you analyze and choose the most suitable database for your social platform. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - High read-to-write ratio (80% reads, 20% writes)
   - Large user base (millions of users)
   - Expected growth
   - High data read speed required
   - Complex relationships (user connections, posts, profiles)
   - Scalability is crucial

2. **Database Type Considerations**

   a) **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**
   - Pros:
     - Strong ACID compliance
     - Excellent for complex relationships
     - Mature ecosystem
   - Cons:
     - Can be challenging to scale horizontally
     - Read performance might not be optimal for the 80% read workload
     - Vertical scaling can become expensive

   b) **NoSQL Databases**
   - Document Stores (MongoDB)
     - Pros:
       - Good for flexible schemas
       - Horizontal scaling
     - Cons:
       - Not ideal for complex relationships
       - Eventual consistency might be an issue for social features

   - Graph Databases (Neo4j)
     - Pros:
       - Excellent for relationship-heavy data
       - Great for social connections
     - Cons:
       - Can be expensive at scale
       - Might be overkill for simple data structures

   - Key-Value Stores (Redis)
     - Pros:
       - Extremely fast reads
       - Great for caching
     - Cons:
       - Limited query capabilities
       - Not suitable as primary database

3. **Recommended Solution: Hybrid Approach**

I recommend using a combination of databases:

**Primary Database: PostgreSQL**
- Why PostgreSQL?
  - Excellent for complex relationships and data integrity
  - Strong ACID compliance
  - JSON support for flexible data
  - Mature ecosystem and community
  - Can handle complex queries efficiently
  - Supports partitioning and sharding

**Caching Layer: Redis**
- Why Redis?
  - In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
  - Can handle the 80% read workload efficiently
  - Supports various data structures
  - Can be used for real-time features

**Architecture Details:**

1. **Data Storage Strategy:**
   - User profiles, posts, and core data in PostgreSQL
   - Frequently accessed data cached in Redis
   - Use Redis for:
     - User sessions
     - Feed data
     - Real-time counters
     - Temporary data

2. **Scaling Strategy:**
   - PostgreSQL:
     - Read replicas for scaling reads
     - Sharding for horizontal scaling
     - Partitioning for large tables
   - Redis:
     - Redis Cluster for horizontal scaling
     - Master-replica setup for high availability

3. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Implement caching strategies:
     - Cache user profiles
     - Cache feed data
     - Cache connection data
   - Use connection pooling
   - Implement proper indexing
   - Use materialized views for complex queries

4. **Data Consistency:**
   - Use Redis as a write-through cache
   - Implement proper cache invalidation strategies
   - Use database transactions for critical operations

This hybrid approach provides:
- High read performance through Redis caching
- Strong data consistency through PostgreSQL
- Scalability through both horizontal and vertical scaling options
- Flexibility to handle complex relationships
- Cost-effectiveness through efficient resource utilization

The solution can be scaled by:
1. Adding more Redis nodes for increased caching capacity
2. Adding PostgreSQL read replicas for increased read capacity
3. Implementing sharding when needed
4. Using connection pooling and load balancing

This architecture has been proven in production by many large-scale social platforms and provides a good balance between performance, scalability, and maintainability.
