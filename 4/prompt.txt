You have an input, which is a piece of the code. You'll need to review it.
You should have done a review from 3 perspectives:
1. You are a seasoned, experienced JavaScript developer with a great background. Write a review from this standpoint.
2. You are a security engineer. You are a total expert in this field. Write a review from this standpoint.
3. You are a performance specialist. I have been doing it for my whole life. Write a review from this standpoint.

Each feedback should be specific, contain actionable recommendations, and observations to improve the code.

The result is one file that combines all of the feedback from all the roles I listed. 
The expected format of the output is markdown. It should be clear, structured, and concisee.
