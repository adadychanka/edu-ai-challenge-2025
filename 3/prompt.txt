### Input
I'll send you text input in the following message. It can be a file or text. 

### Task
You need to perform sentiment analysis on it. Break down the input into several meaningful parts and measure the sentiment score for each part. 

### Output
The expected result of the analysis is a structured, valid JSON file.

### Analysis
The sentiment analysis should determine the emotional tone of the input. 
Use the following sentiment scores to classify:
Positive: Reflecting optimism or satisfaction.
Neutral: Lacking strong emotional indicators.
Negative: Reflecting dissatisfaction, criticism, or pessimism.

The sentiment score can be a number ranging from -1 to 1.
-1 indicates a very negative sentiment.
0 indicates neutral sentiment.
+1 indicates very positive sentiment.
The value can be a float.

Here are a few examples of scoring:
Example 1:
Text: "I love how easy this app is to use. Great job!";
Sentiment: Positive;
Score: +1;

Example 2:
- Text: "The website keeps crashing every time I try to log in."
-  Sentiment: Negative
- Score: -1

### Output requirements
The result JSON file has to contain:
- short concise summary of the input
- total sentiment score
- result of sentiment analysis along with score for each part
- any metadata you deem useful
